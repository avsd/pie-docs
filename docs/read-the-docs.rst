History
~~~~~~~

Documenting projects is hard, hosting them shouldn't be.
`Read the Docs <http://readthedocs.org>`_ was created to make
hosting documentation simple. I think that we have solved this
problem well, but now we need to start thinking about the larger
picture.

Along with hosting, Read the Docs was created with 2 other main
goals. One was to encourage people to write documentation, by
removing the barrier of entry of hosting. The other was to create a
central platform for people to find documentation. Having a shared
platform for all documentation allows for innovation at the
platform level, allowing work to be done once and benefit everyone.
Having run the site for over a year now, I think there is a third
thing that we should be striving for. That is to make the quality
of documentation better.
