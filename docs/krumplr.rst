What we are all about
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Krumplr brings your To-Dos Together.

You point Krumplr to the sources of your to-dos: your email, online
notes and documents, calendars, other to-do systems and task trackers.
You can then prioritize, schedule, and track all your to-dos in one
place. No importing or syncing required. You can share lists with your
team, your friends, and your family to get things done together.

Private Beta
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Join our private beta! Sign up at `http://krumplr.com`_ and help us
improve what weâ€™ve already built and shape what we still need to build.

You refer new customers to us by sharing a list with somebody who has
not signed up. Refer 5 new users to us and we give you our Pro offering
free for 2 years starting the day it is available. Refer 10 new users
and you become a Pro user for free for life.

You can also `download the iOS app`_ from the App Store.
