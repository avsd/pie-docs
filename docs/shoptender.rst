What we are all about
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ShopTender makes it quick, easy and insightful to sell on social media.

With one tool independent online stores can now send out actionable posts to Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Tumblr. We sync directly with their online inventory to make it incredibly simple to use. A "BUY" button will appear on the posts letting their followers know it is readily available for sale. A reporting dashboard will provide insights on how products are performing by network and provide trending information. Now you can sell better on social media because you can see what your customers want to engage with.
