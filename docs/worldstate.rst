Nick Ferraro

Nick is a fullstack developer at SalesForce and part-time CTO at WorldState. Nick believes cross domain training is just as important as deep dive expertise. Most people say it is not possible, but then again most people leave their job at work. He thoroughly enjoy Software Engineering and therefore constantly explore new technologies, frameworks, and languages.
