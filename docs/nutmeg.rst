What are we all about
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nutmeg gives you easy access to gifs worth texting.

It’s ridiculously simple: pick a gif, double tap it into iMessage, and
text it to your friends! Be as adorable as Jennifer Lawrence or as
awkward as Kristin Wiig. It’s time to up your text game.

Not every gif is worth sharing. We find the ones that are and make it
easy for you to text them. Spend less time searching for the right gif
and more time enjoying conversations with your friends.
