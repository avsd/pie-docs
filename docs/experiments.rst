What XOBXOB is About
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Friendly Smart Things.

Imagine. Your home knows when you’ve had a bad day. When you return, the lights are on and the fire is burning. And, maybe, your favorite drink is mixed and waiting. This reality is still in the future, but with the explosion of the Internet of Things, it’s closer than you might imagine.

Right now, the thing about the Internet of Things, is that it’s a lot of things connecting with other things. XOBXOB is working on connecting things with you to create personal and responsive experiences.
