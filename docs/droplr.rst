Collaboration is key in design, whether it’s swapping ideas with
colleagues or sharing comps with clients. Droplr is a simple cloud file
sharing tool that makes sharing your stuff second nature.

About
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sharing your work should be easy. It shouldn’t take a ton of annoying
steps involving multiple apps. That’s why we created Droplr. We were
tired of wasting countless hours just trying to share and collaborate.
We wanted to remove barriers to creativity and productivity, to get more
stuff done.

Droplr helps you work faster, better, and smarter. With Droplr, you can
swap screenshots and share files in seconds. You can record screencasts
in minutes and distribute them instantly. It runs in the background,
becomes a streamlined part of your workflow. It’s a simple, fast tool
made for creative professionals. We use it all the time and we love it.

Our Philosophy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The tools we use should be intuitive, unobtrusive, and beautiful. They
should help us be better at what we do. We made Droplr behave like the
apps creative professionals use every day. We made it work with the apps
creative professionals use every day. It’s fully integrated with the
Adobe Creative suite, Sketch, Slack, and countless other apps. It just
works.

Our Team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
