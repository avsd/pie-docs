What we're doing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Outdoor Project is revolutionizing the way people get outside to have incredible outdoor experiences. Itâ€™s a place where you can find your next adventure and get the essentials you need to make it happen.

We currently feature over 1,500 adventures across the West Coast, covering every type of human-powered adventure. This includes the popular, but often overlooked, adventures like swimming holes, lakes and campgrounds. Each comes with a field guide and custom map so you have everything you need for a great trip.
