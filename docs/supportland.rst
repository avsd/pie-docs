Supportland is a technology company with a social mission that enables independent businesses to create stronger local economies, enhance customer loyalty and increase revenue with a flexible, measurable tool.

Independent businesses make up about one-third of the U.S. economy, but are unable to take competitive advantage of this market share because they don't leverage their most critical resource; shared customers. 

Our Technology
~~~~~~~~

Under the guise of simply opting into cross promotions, Supportland enables independent businesses to leverage data in a way that works seamlessly with their existing their work flow. No number crunching. No lengthy staff trainings. No proprietary equipment. Supportland radically reframes local economies into one cohesive experience for business owners, employees and their customers.

Supportland will be launching Version 2 of our platform next week in Portland followed up by launches in other Northwest communities in November. Please contact Katrina Scotto di Carlo to follow up.

Our Team
~~~~~~~~

Michael and Katrina Scotto di Carlo started Supportland in 2010 because they love independent businesses and felt they could do more to support them. Katrina and Michael combined their backgrounds in technology and art to build a sophisticated, easy-to-use software platform specifically for independent businesses. They have expanded their team to include people in web development, sales and communications.
